# Internet-of-Things-281-Arduino-Sensory-Systems-Innovating-Safety-Solutions
Utilize the Arduino Uno to create innovative projects by integrating actuators and sensors. This guideline requires a simulated project to demonstrate proficiency with the Arduino Uno.

**Outline**:
Choose one of two options and execute the following tasks:
a. Build a circuit on TinkerCad using specified components.
b. Submit an Arduino sketch demonstrating the designed program.
c. Provide a schematic drawing of the circuit for future reference.
d. Submit a technical report encompassing tasks b and c, adhering to the technical report guide.

**Option 1: Smoke Detection System**:
Utilize the provided components to construct a smoke detection system. When hazardous smoke levels are detected:
* Red LED flashes.
* Buzzer sounds alarm until pushbutton is pressed to reset.
* LCD communicates system state continuously.
* Expand the system for potential market readiness.

**Option 2: Human Detection Probe**:
Create a probe using specified components to detect humans covered in debris post-earthquake. When a human is detected:
* Buzzer emits beeps.
* Red LED flashes until pushbutton is pressed to reset.
* LCD displays system status continually.
* Enhance the system for market viability.
